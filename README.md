Overview

This project focuses on predicting diabetes in patients based on diagnostic measurements. The main objective is to develop machine learning models that can accurately classify whether a person has diabetes or not. 
The project follows a complete workflow starting from data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training and evaluation, to user-input-based predictions. 
It demonstrates how machine learning can assist in medical diagnostics and provides a hands-on approach to building predictive models.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, which contains 768 instances and 9 features. These features include Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Age, and the target variable Outcome. 
The Outcome variable indicates whether a patient is diabetic (1) or not (0). This dataset is widely used for diabetes prediction tasks and provides a balanced mix of numerical and categorical attributes.
